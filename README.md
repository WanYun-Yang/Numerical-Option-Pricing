&emsp; In this project, we focused on the numerical performance of different options and used three prevailing discretization schemes to give an extensive analysis of the options considered. We want to calculate this Black-Scholes equation in the following three ways to compare the performance and accuracy: forward difference, Crank-Nicolson, and solve a parabolic equation transformed from e Black-Scholes Equation. We view the answer generated by binomial tree as the exact solution.

### An introduction to Black-Scholes equation and options
&emsp; This is the page of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_equation" title="Title">
Black-Scholes equation</a> on Wikipedia. 
We want to calculate four kinds of option: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp" title="Title">
European call</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp" title="Title">
European put</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp" title="Title">
American call</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp" title="Title">
American call</a>. 

### Three ways to calculate Black-Scholes equation
* Forward difference method(FD_OptionPricing.m). <br>
&emsp; A simple, explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference" title="Title">
 finite difference method</a> to numerically solve partial differential equations. Notice that it must satisfy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition" title="Title">
CFL condition</a>. That means, it's conditionally stable. <br> <br>
* Direct Crank-Nicolson method(CN_OptionPricing.m). <br>
&emsp; A implicit finite difference method to numerically solve partial differential equations. It's unconditionally stable, but we have to solve a tridiagonal matrix each step. To speed up calculation, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm" title="Title">Thomas algorithm</a> to deal with the tridiagonal matrix. <br> <br>
* Heat Crank-Nicolson method(HT_OptionPricing.m). <br>
&emsp; See <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395139424085/Extended%20Abstract.pdf" title="Title">Finite Differences Schemes for Pricing of European and American Options</a>.

### Error Analysis
&emsp; The error comes from two place:
* The maximum of boundary <br>
&emsp; When we do numerical calculation, we need to set the maximum stock price Smax and calculate in [0, T] X [0, Smax]. It converges as Smax goes to infinity.
* Truncation error <br>
&emsp; A kind of error made by truncating the taylor expansion into finite sum. It converges as dt, ds go to zero.

### Conclusion
&emsp;We use four ways to calculate option price and all of them converges.
