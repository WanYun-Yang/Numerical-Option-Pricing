&emsp; In this project, we focused on the numerical performance of different options and used three prevailing discretization schemes to give an extensive analysis of the options considered. We want to calculate this Black-Scholes equation in the following three ways to compare the performance and accuracy: forward difference, Crank-Nicolson, and solve a parabolic equation transformed from e Black-Scholes Equation. We view the answer generated by binomial tree as the exact solution.
